# FragmentExampleApp
This app has two buttons and two fragments.  The app starts on the first (green) fragment. If you tap the button for the first fragment, it will stay on the first one, but if you tap the button for the second fragment, it will change to the second (red) fragment.  Thus, you can go back and forth.
